### Origins of the diffraction patttern

#### Single Crystal Diffraction

+ Diffracting X-rays from single crystals and powders are methods of visualizing the reciprocal lattice with various distortions introduced by a particular experimental geometry.
+ Three elements, X-Ray tube, sample holder and X-ray detector
	+ Electrons are accelerated and impact a target material, results in characteristic wavelengths $K_\alpha$

#### Powder Diffraction Pattern

> For single crystals the atomic planes will diffract the X-Rays at an angle $\theta$ determined by. the distance between planes

+ Most materials are not single crystals but billions of tiny crystallites. All possible interatomic planes will be seen by the beam, diffraction from each type of plane will occur at a specific diffraction angle $\theta$

Consider the Following

+ A $d_{hkl}^*$ vector associated with each point in the reciprocal lattice with its origin on the Ewald sphere at the point where the direct X-Ray beam exits
+ Each crystallite located at the center of the ewald sphere has its own reciprocal lattice with an orientation determined by the orientation of the crystallite in respect to the X-ray beam
