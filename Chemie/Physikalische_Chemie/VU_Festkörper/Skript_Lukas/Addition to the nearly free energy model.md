+ The band structure of a crystal can be explained with the nearly free electron model where the band electrons are perturbed only weakly by the periodic potential of the ion cores

In the free electron model the dispersion is

$E = \hbar^2 |k|^2 / 2m$ corresponding to eigenfunctions $|k\rangle$ and a real space representation $\psi(r) \propto e^{ikr}$ in a free electron model

+ there is only one band
+ the band structure is not periodic
+ the Brillouin zone is infinite in k space

> Within the nearly free electron model we start from the dispersion relation of free electron and analyze the effect of introducing a small lattice potential
