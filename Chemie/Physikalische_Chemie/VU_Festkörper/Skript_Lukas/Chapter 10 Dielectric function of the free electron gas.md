> The dielectric function $\epsilon(\omega,K)$ of the electron gas has significant consequences for the optical properties of solid metals. It measures the ability to store electric energy in an electrical field.

Definition

$D = \epsilon_0 E + P = \epsilon \epsilon_0 E$  with $P = \epsilon_0 \chi E$ 

Here D ist the electric displacement field, P the polarization, $\epsilon$ the relative permittivity, and $\chi$ the electric susceptibility

$\epsilon$ is infinite for metals where the applied electric field is spatially uniform. The electrons in the metal are free to arrange themselves until their own electric field counters the externally applied field $D$ Thus the total field $E=0$ 

> Screening is a phenomena where the electrons will be attracted to surround the positive charge in the free electron model

This rearrangement introduces a induced charge distribution $\rho_{ind}$ the total charge density $\rho(r) = \rho_{ext} + \rho_{ind}(r)$ is less positive

> $\epsilon(\omega,0)$ describes the collective excitations of the Fermi sea

+ Motion in an electric field: $m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=-eE$ 
+ For oscillating x and E: $-\omega^2 mx 0 -eE$ and $x = \frac{eE}{m\omega^2}$ 

We can thus introduce the plasma frequency $w_p$ 

$w_p^2 = \frac{ne^2}{\epsilon_0 m}$ 

+ For most metals this plasma frequency is in the ultra-violet regime, energies of 5-15 eV
+ A plasma is a medium with equal concentration of positive and negative charges, with at least one charge being mobile.
+ In a solid the negative charges of the conduction electrons are balanced by the positive charges of the ion cores
