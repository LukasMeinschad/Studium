## Revision Structure Factor:

Structure factor $F_{hkl}$ is a mathematical function describing the amplitude and phase of a wave diffracted from crystal lattice planes characterizes by Miller indices $h,k,l$

Structure Factor may be expressed as

$F_{hkl} = F_{hkl} \exp(i \alpha_{hkl}) = \sum_{j} f_j \exp(2\pi i (hx_k + ky_j + lz_j))$

+ Sum over all atoms in the unit cell
+ $x_j,y_j,z_j$ are the positional coordinates of the $j$th atom,
+ $f_j$ is the scattering factor of $j$th atom and
+ $\alpha_{hkl}$ is the phase of the diffracted beam
